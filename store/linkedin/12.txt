About The Role

At ANZ our purpose is to shape a world where people and communities thrive. We’re making this happen by improving our customers’ financial wellbeing so they can achieve incredible things – be it buying their home, building a business or saving for things big or small.

What Will Your Day Look Like

As a Site Reliability Engineer within the ANZx SRE squad, you will be instrumental in building and shaping our SRE function, who will be responsible for building and running the cloud platforms for one of Australia's largest financial institutions.

We're doing things differently for the cloud. You will apply SRE principles to ensure we monitor and measure what is important, you will automate our platforms and services for reliable operations at scale, including automation of our security and governance controls.

We use many of the latest and greatest open source tools, so you will need to be comfortable with constantly learning new tools and techniques along with running proof of concept evaluations to keep us on the leading edge.

We will turn to you for suggestions on how to improve the platforms, processes and tools. We expect that you already have great ideas you can share at our cloud guilds & user groups, along with industry Meetups.

What will you bring?

We are looking for an engineer that already possess some of the following skills:

Comfortable coding in one or more languages (bash, JavaScript, Golang, Python, Powershell etc), and you use these skills to automate as much as possible
Ability to design and implement cloud security, availability and reliability best practices
Solid skills in IP networking
Proficient with Docker, Kubernetes/OpenShift
Experience implementing Infrastructure as code via eg Terraform/Cloudformation, along with continuous integration/delivery tooling such as Bitbucket/GitHub, Google Cloud Build/Bamboo/Jenkins, Spinnaker, etc.
Experience working with operations and architecture groups developing scalable and supportable solutions
Experience with Logging tools such as Stack Driver and Splunk
Experience in Alerting and Visualisation tools such as Grafana and Slack
experience with Application monitoring and assisted tooling such as New Relic and Dynatrace


So, why join us?

We’re reinventing the way we do banking, and our community of collaborative, innovative thinkers who create human centred solutions are helping us get there. We’re responding faster to changing customer requirements, focusing on the things that matter and helping people achieve incredible things – be it buying their home, building a business or saving for things big or small.

We support our people by providing a range of flexible working options so they can work in the way that best suits them. We encourage you to talk to us about your need for flexibility and any adjustments you may require to our recruitment process or the role itself.

Develop your career, work in a diverse and inclusive workplace where the different backgrounds, perspectives and life experiences of our people are celebrated and create a great place to grow, thrive and belong.
