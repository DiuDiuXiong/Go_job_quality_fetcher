The GitLab DevSecOps platform empowers 100,000+ organizations to deliver software faster and more efficiently. We are one of the world’s largest all-remote companies with 2,000+ team members and values that foster a culture where people embrace the belief that everyone can contribute. Learn more about Life at GitLab .

Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) are responsible for keeping all user-facing services and other GitLab production systems running smoothly. SREs are a blend of pragmatic operators and software craftspeople that apply sound engineering principles, operational discipline, and mature automation to our environments and the GitLab codebase. We specialize in systems, whether it be networking, the Linux kernel, or some more specific interest in scaling, algorithms, or distributed systems.

The Database Reliability Team 's mission is to build, run and own the entire lifecycle of the PostgreSQL database engine for GitLab.com. The team is focused on owning the reliability, scalability, performance & security of the database engine and its supporting services. The team should be seeking to build their services on top of Reliability::Foundations services and cloud vendor managed products, where appropriate, to reduce complexity, improve efficiency and deliver new capabilities quicker.

GitLab.com is a unique site and it brings unique challenges–it’s the biggest GitLab instance in existence. In fact, it’s one of the largest single-tenancy open-source SaaS sites on the internet. The experience of our team feeds back into other engineering groups within the company, as well as to GitLab customers running self-managed installations

As An SRE You Will

Be on an on-call (PagerDuty) rotation to respond to incidents that impact GitLab.com availability, and provide support for service engineers with customer incidents.
Use your on-call shift to prevent incidents from ever happening.
Run our infrastructure with Chef, Ansible, Terraform, GitLab CI/CD, and Kubernetes.
Build monitoring that alerts on symptoms rather than on outages.
Document every action so your findings turn into repeatable actions and then into automation.

Design, build and maintain core infrastructure that enables GitLab scaling to support hundreds of thousands of concurrent users.

Know your way around Linux and the Unix Shell.
Have an urge to collaborate and communicate asynchronously.
Have an urge to document all the things so you don’t need to learn the same thing twice.

Have an urge for delivering quickly and effectively, and iterating fast.
Share our values , and work in accordance with those values.
