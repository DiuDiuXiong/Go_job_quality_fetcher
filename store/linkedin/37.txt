At Ping Identity we're changing the way people think about enterprise security technology. With our innovative Identity Defined Security platform we're building a borderless world where people have total freedom to work wherever and however they want. Without friction. Without fear.




We call this digital freedom. And it's not just something we provide our customers. It's something that drives our company. People don't come here to join a culture that's built on digital freedom. They come to cultivate it.




We're headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and we have offices and employees around the globe. We serve the largest, most demanding enterprises worldwide, including over half of the Fortune 100. Because even in the most complex enterprise environments, security shouldn't be a source of anxiety; It is your greatest competitive advantage.




As a Ping Identity SRE you will be involved in every facet of our On-Demand SaaS services and will develop the infrastructure of one of the largest identity platforms in the world. You will report to the Australian Site Reliability Engineering Manager.

We're looking for engineers from a variety of backgrounds that are interested to bring their experience and skills to the team. It's not essential that you've worked as an SRE before (although we are looking for experienced SREs too); we can provide coached, hands-on, experience to grow you in to the role, as well as assistance obtaining industry recognized certifications.
