Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora,你好, hallo, vítejte!




Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.




Where And How You Can Work




Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.




What You’d Be Doing In This Role




As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.




The Observability Team is responsible for all operational insights inside Canva. Our goal is to provide our development team with world-class tools to view how their services are performing in production. We achieve this by combining industry-leading third-party solutions with our own in-house developed solutions.




We work across the entire stack maintaining our metrics and logging Java libraries, our logging and metrics infrastructure, error and alert routing, and our incident management process to name just a few. As we scale all of these areas require more sophisticated solutions to ensure that Canva developers can continue to grow without compromising on reliability or availability.




What You'll Do (Responsibilities)




As a technical lead, you will guide the design and implementation of some of our major projects like scaling our Logging, Metrics and Tracing tooling.
Help identify gaps in Observability tooling at Canva and help take it to the next level.
Be proactive in modernising our Observability tooling and participate in brainstorming and POC’ing to determine how we can improve our existing systems
Become an authority in the area of Observability and evangelise the benefits of accurate instrumentation throughout the organisation
Help build new features into our Logging and Alerting pipelines to ensure that people are getting notifications for errors that are related to their domains
Help develop solutions to tackle difficult problems such as how to deal with high-cardinality metrics which we can’t solve with our existing tooling
Guide and mentor other people on the team and help them grow their skills and knowledge




Required Skills & Experience




Comfortable and happy to code in Python, Java or Golang
Deep knowledge and understanding of Computer Engineering fundamentals and first principles
Experience building and running monitoring infrastructure at a large scale. For example, Terabyte-scale Elasticsearch clusters, Prometheus, Kibana, Grafana, etc
Experience working with and monitoring microservice architectures in large distributed cloud environments (ideally AWS).
Experience with Observability tooling – having proficiency with tools like Datadog, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Loggly, Sentry, or similar
Experience with infrastructure-as-code, we’re a Terraform shop, but strong experience with other IaC tools will do the trick
The ability to guide and mentor other members within the team and improve the way we collaborate, learn, and share ideas
This role requires a lot of documentation and internal team members alignment; therefore strong written and verbal communication skills are required




Not essential; but helpful experience!




Experience writing application code in Java since we also maintain the metrics, tracing and logging java libraries.
Experience building and running monitoring infrastructure on a large scale. For example, Terabyte-scale Elasticsearch clusters, Prometheus, Kibana, Grafana, etc
Experience with OpenTelemetry or writing code in Golang since we are adopting OpenTelemetry in a lot of the tooling we provide.




Perks And Benefits




Competitive salary, plus stock options via our ESOP plan
Flexible daily working hours, we value work-life balance
Breakfast and lunch prepared by our wonderful Vibe team
Onsite-Gym and Yoga Membership
End-of-Trip Facilities: Bicycle parking and showers
Generous parental (including secondary) leave policy
Pet-friendly offices
Internal Coaches and an Employee Wellness Program
Sponsored social clubs, team events, and celebrations
Relocation budget for interstate or overseas individuals (including visa sponsorship)




What's in it for you?




Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.




Here's a Taste Of What's On Offer




Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
