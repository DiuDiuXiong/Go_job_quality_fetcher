Who we are:




Squiz helps complex, service-led organisations harness the power of digital, improving the services they offer online.




Founded in 1998, Squiz grew during the rise of the internet. Since then, we have evolved from a simple web content management system into a full digital experience platform (DXP), helping customers make the shift from being content managers to experience creators.




The Squiz DXP brings together content, search, data and applications in one place. To get the most out of the platform, customers can collaborate with our digital experts to design solutions and adapt as demands change.




We are headquartered in Australia, with teams and customers across the globe, and offices in New Zealand, the United States, the United Kingdom and Poland.




We celebrate diversity and unite on the elements of our company DNA, starting every customer conversation with “why?” to really understand their needs, working hard to find a way to overcome every challenge, and fighting for better outcomes with the work we do. We also check our egos at door, we don’t take ourselves too seriously and we have fun along the way.




We are a 2023 Circle Back Initiative Employer – we commit to respond to every applicant.
