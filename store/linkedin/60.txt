How You’ll Make a Difference




We are looking for a Senior DevOps Engineer who is committed to taking on juicy technical challenges to help us grow to a massive scale. You will join a passionate SRE team to build and support a robust and highly-scalable cloud infrastructure while seeking opportunities to continuously improve developer experience and optimise our processes through automation. You will identify, plan and implement the tools that allow engineers to release features quickly, frequently and confidently. Resilience and availability are a cornerstone of every change you make, and you know how to build secure systems. Above all you’ll love working in a creative, supportive team environment whilst having access to the latest tools and technologies.




We’d be excited if you have the below experience:




Proficient at building and maintaining scalable and reliable cloud-based infrastructure supporting hundreds of thousands of monthly active users;




Experience as a DevOps Engineer working with AWS primitives;




Experience with Kubernetes and Docker containers;




Experience with software development practices and technologies (ie. design, implementation and deployment of applications in any modern language);




Experience creating automated solutions with a major scripting language such as Shell or Python




Experience managing Linux Systems;




CI/CD pipeline tool experience (e.g. GitLab, ArgoCD, etc);




Architecture as code (eg. Terraform, Cloud Formation, etc..); and




A good understanding of networking concepts and internet protocols.




Although we’d be excited if you have the above experience, it’s definitely not a show-stopper. If you are excited about this role but not sure if you meet all of the criteria, please still apply as we’d love to hear from you!
