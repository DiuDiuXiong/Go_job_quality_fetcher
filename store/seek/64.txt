Senior Cyber Security Engineer

The safety and wellbeing of our employees and potential employees is important to us. We want to assure candidates that there is no expectation from Wrkr to meet face-to-face and a virtual interview will not adversely impact your application. Therefore we will conduct interviews with candidates via Google Meets. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact us.

Who we are

Wrkr Ltd is a recently merged ASX listed business with the passion and energy of a start-up, with our award winning Platform, that currently helps close to 3 million Australian workers resolve their compliance moments in partnership with many of Australia’s leading payrolls, superannuation funds and accountants.

Our purpose is to make “Compliance, Simple.” and we’re embarking on our next phase of growth. So if you’re looking for a front row seat in an inclusive and supportive environment, and want to make a real impact on our award winning product, then this is the role for you.

We are born out of a startup with an impressive track record of delivering value in the Superannuation, business and citizen compliance industry. With us, you’ll ignite a meaningful career while being supported by a flexible working culture, innovative learning and development opportunities, policies and benefits of a progressive tech business.

Please keep reading... Research shows that while men apply to jobs when they meet an average of 60% of the criteria, women and other marginalised folk tend to only apply when they check every box. So if you think you have what it takes, but don’t necessarily meet every single point on the job description, please still get in touch. We’d love to have a chat and see if you could be a great fit.
