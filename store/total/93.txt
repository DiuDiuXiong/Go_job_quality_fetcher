DevSecOps Engineer - $800/day - 12 months rolling

Long term contract opportunity with a well established national brand. This would suit an established Systems Admin/DevOps engineer with a passion for security who wants to transition into more of a DevSecOps style role. Minimum requirements to apply are being strong with both Terraform and AWS.

Hybrid working. Must be happy to commute to office 1 day per week.



What you will be doing:

Configuring security tools like Akamai WAF, Bot Manager, Qualys, Crowdstrike, ZScaler, Cloud Conformity, etc
Maintaining high quality secure code and infrastructure, identifying and remediating security vulnerabilities
Implementation and management of AWS cloud security services
Working with scripting languages such as Python, Bash
SIEM logging & event management tools such as Splunk, Appdynamics & DataDog
Operations, maintenance, site reliability engineering, and security
Monitoring highly available applications and core systems
Administering Linux at scale
Championing of industry compliance and security standards such as PCI DSS, CIS
CI/CD, DevOps automation engineering and processes
Ansible, Terraform
Experience in all tools is certainly not essential but as a minimum ideally you will have AWS experience and Infrastructure as Code.
