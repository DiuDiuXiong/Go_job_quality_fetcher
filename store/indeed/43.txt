Grace Anglican Churches, Camden Valley
Location: Harrington Park and surrounds (Parish of Camden Valley), NSW
Date advertised: 25th May 2023
Job Type: Part time
Closing Date: 7 August 2023

The vision of Grace Anglican Churches, Camden Valley is to see a community of God’s people who are so anchored in and compelled by God’s grace to us in Jesus that we give ourselves wholeheartedly to see a multitude of people, who are saved and transformed by God’s grace, and form a network of churches in the Camden Valley.

We have begun to multiply churches in this high population growth area and, under God, are planning to continue this in the years ahead. A vital aspect of this will be the continued development of our children’s ministry – building on the great foundation laid over the past 17 years.

To this end, we are seeking a Children’s Ministry Team Leader to oversee and direct our various children’s ministry leaders and teams while our current Team Leader is taking maternity leave.

The role will be part-time (3-4 days per week including Sunday) during the period of maternity leave, with the potential to develop into a related role beyond the maternity leave period.

The role will suit someone with a passion for children’s ministry, who is able to lead and mentor teams of leaders. It will involve planning, programming and serving in various children’s ministries across the Parish (kids’ talks, kids’ church, kids’ club, SRE) as part of an excellent leadership team.

Commencement date is negotiable, ideally from September 2023, but a delayed start date is possible for the right candidate.
